Hello, world!

<!--more-->
My name is GU YI. I am currently pursuing a master's degree in Electrical and Computer Engineering at Cornell University. Prior to this, I earned my bachelor's degree in Computer Science from The Hong Kong University of Science and Technology.

I am also an avid scuba diver, holding an AOW license, and have had the opportunity to dive in six different countries.
